<h1>UMRAH JOURNEY / 3rd FEBRUARY 2019</h1>
<center><img src="image/makkah.jpg" width="35%" height="30%"></center>
<p>Umrah was an amazing experience. I would love to go there again and again <br>
I'd love to go there with my parents and my whole family.</p><br>

<center><img src="image/makkah1.jpg" width="30%" height="30%"></center>
<p>We went to Makkah first, my family and I then went to Madinah, Masjid An-Nabawi 
and Masjid Al-Haram. <br>I miss these Masjids already. The first time ever I felt so close to 
Nabi Muhammad SAW and Allah SWT.<br> The first time ever my heart beats in zikir. The first time 
ever my brain resets itself from internet, <br>social and all the worldly desires,
only thinking of my relationship with Him.</p><br><br>

<p class="small">I have so much to learn. The knowledge I gained from university and school days
dissipates into nothingness when I looked at Kaabah. 
To me, my knowledge in Islam is only as big as my little finger.
How can I not be embarassed? So, when I was there, in these beautiful Masjids,
when I saw Kaabah, I kept crying and crying. Allah SWT has blessed us with so many
great amzing awesome things, and it's high time to contribute back.</p>
